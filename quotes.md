* Only 1 Verkehrsverbund claimed to receive schedule data in GTFS format [Kaufmann 2014 S. 99]

* The situation in Germany concerning transit data appears to be pro- foundly different from the situation that led US transit agencies to open their transit data to interested developers. While GTFS was the first standardized transit data exchange format in the USA and has become the de-facto standard for open transit data throughout the world, transit data model standardization is much further advanced in Europe. German transit agencies rely on a series of established data exchange standards, two dominant ones of which are propri- etary with little or no documentation publicly available to open tran- sit developers. Also, in contrast to the United States, where providing developers with transit data was the first step in arriving at online journey planning services for a series of transit agencies, such ser- vices already exist literally nationwide in Germany.
